* `npm start` - Spins up express server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.
* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).
* `npm run dev:nw` - Same as `npm start`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.
* `npm run dev:no-debug` - Same as `npm start` but disables redux devtools.
* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.
* `npm run test:dev` - Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.
* `npm run deploy`- Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.
